## Progress and Issues
**What you did:**  
The team completed frontend integration for activity creation and recommendation features, wrote unit and integration tests for multiple views, and transitioned the backend from Firebase to Prisma. Authentication and user APIs were set up, Firebase wiring was tested, and sample data was generated for users and activities. Documentation, including architecture and design deliverables, was finalized and uploaded.  

**What worked:**  
Front-end components for tag and location selection, activity display, and authentication performed as expected. The Jest and React Testing Library setup proved effective for simulating user interactions and validating UI behavior. The Prisma migration improved database stability and schema consistency. Team collaboration streamlined debugging and clarified integration points between backend and frontend modules.  

**What you learned:**  
The team learned to test React components that rely on asynchronous Firebase or Prisma data, integrate modular APIs with frontend logic, and manage state efficiently for dynamic components like dropdowns and recommendations. Members also gained experience connecting mobile OAuth authentication and setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.  

**Where you had trouble:**  
Some issues arose while mocking Firebase authentication and Firestore listeners during testing, tuning the recommendation algorithm for relevance, and resolving schema mismatches after switching to Prisma. A few asynchronous rendering behaviors caused intermittent test failures.  

**Where you are stuck:**  
The team is waiting on finalized backend endpoints for full authentication and recommendation integration. Some Firebase-related test mocks still behave inconsistently, and optimization work is ongoing for real-time recommendation queries and API connections.
