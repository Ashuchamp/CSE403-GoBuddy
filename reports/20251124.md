---

## 2. Progress and Issues

### What you did
1. Completed major feature implementations across the product, including the Notification Center, AI recommendations, authentication flows, and map view groundwork.  
2. Updated and expanded UI test coverage, refined documentation, and polished navigation and demo flow.  

### What worked
1. Core features such as notifications, authentication, and AI recommendations functioned reliably in testing and improved overall user experience.  
2. UI and navigation refinements made the app feel smoother and more consistent across screens.  

### What you learned
1. The team gained stronger understanding of asynchronous behavior in UI testing and rendering.  
2. Members learned how to integrate new components (AI, maps, real-time notifications) into existing app architecture.  

### Where you had trouble
1. Some UI components and tests were difficult to update due to dynamic rendering and changing flows.  
2. Navigation edge cases, state updates, and timing issues caused occasional lag or routing conflicts.  

### Where you are stuck
1. A few failing or flaky tests remain unresolved, particularly around delayed UI updates and edge-case interactions.  
2. Map interaction design and full navigation coverage still need clarity before final integration.

## 3. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
1. Finalize remaining UI tests and resolve flaky or failing cases.  
2. Complete the map feature, including implementation and test coverage.  
3. Refine demo readiness with polished onboarding, feature flows, and slide deck.  
4. Improve AI filtering (Aaryan) with harassment-aware logic instead of simple keyword blocking.  
5. Fix remaining UI test failures and support demo polishing (Ray).  
6. Finalize missing test coverage and complete presentation materials (Ting-Yu).  
7. Finish map view, add tests, and clean up UI details (Kehan).  
8. Address navigation edge cases and ensure smooth onboarding (Matthew).  
9. Build out map feature planning and implementation (Sophia).

## Ray Xu

### 1. Last Week’s Goals
1. Add remaining UI tests  
2. Finalize documentation updates  
3. Support final demo refinement  

### 2. Progress and Issues
#### What you did
1. I added the remaining UI tests covering edge cases in the activity search and filtering flows.  
2. I reviewed and finalized the documentation updates to align with the current feature set for the demo.  

#### What worked
1. The new UI tests ran consistently in CI and helped confirm stable behavior across navigation paths.  
2. The documentation updates made the demo flow clearer and reduced confusion during handoffs.  

#### What you learned
1. I learned how to structure UI tests to better handle asynchronous rendering and user interactions.  
2. I gained a clearer understanding of how thorough documentation improves demo readiness and team alignment.  

#### Where you had trouble
1. Some UI components were hard to test due to dynamic rendering, which required refactoring selectors and timing.  
2. Coordinating changes across multiple documentation sections took more time than expected to keep everything consistent.  

#### Where you are stuck
1. I’m still uncertain about how to handle a few failing tests related to delayed UI updates.  
2. I’m not fully sure whether certain demo flow interactions need additional test coverage or can be deferred.  

### 3. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
1. Fix the remaining failing UI tests and improve test reliability around asynchronous updates.  
2. Support final polishing for the demo, including UI consistency checks and any required documentation tweaks.

## Ting-Yu Hsu

### 1. Last Week’s Goals
1. Check and update all remaining UI tests.  
2. Finalize documentation.  
3. Work on the final demo with the group, improve and update the final slide.  

### 2. Progress and Issues
#### What you did
1. I checked and updated the remaining UI tests to match the latest feature changes.  
2. I worked with the team to refine the final demo flow and updated the final slide content.  

#### What worked
1. The updated UI tests ran smoothly and helped confirm stable behavior in key user flows.  
2. The slide revisions made the demo structure clearer and easier for the team to present.  

#### What you learned
1. I learned how to identify outdated or redundant tests and update them for new UI logic.  
2. I gained experience improving demo storytelling so the product value is communicated more clearly.  

#### Where you had trouble
1. Some tests were difficult to update because the UI components had changed significantly.  
2. Coordinating demo content timing across team members took longer than expected.  

#### Where you are stuck
1. I’m still unsure whether a few UI flows need additional tests or can be left as-is for the final submission.  
2. I’m not fully confident that the current slide flow highlights all key features effectively.  

### 3. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
1. Finalize any missing UI test coverage and resolve remaining inconsistencies.  
2. Help polish the demo presentation and ensure the final slide deck is complete and cohesive.

## Kehan Jin

### 1. Last Week’s Goals
1. Fully stabilize the activity refresh logic across different network conditions (2 days)  
2. Continue refining UI transitions and eliminate flickering in nested screens (1 days)  
3. Strengthen asynchronous UI tests and fix remaining flaky cases (2 days)  
4. Assist in integrating new Notification Center UI components into existing flows (1 days)  

### 2. Progress and Issues
#### What you did

2. Debugging occasional UI delays during login took longer than expected due to timing issues.  

#### Where you are stuck
1. I’m still unsure whether we need additional checks for re-authentication after app backgrounding.  
2. I’m not fully confident that all navigation edge cases are covered, especially on rapid screen changes.  

### 3. Plans and Goals for the Next Week
1. Address remaining navigation inconsistencies and refine edge-case authentication behavior.  
2. Help support the demo by ensuring the user onboarding flow is smooth and reliable.
