   2. Complete the map feature, including implementation and test coverage.  
   3. Refine demo readiness with polished onboarding, feature flows, and slide deck.  
   4. Improve AI filtering (Aaryan) with harassment-aware logic instead of simple keyword blocking.  
   5. Fix remaining UI test failures and support demo polishing (Ray).  
   6. Finalize missing test coverage and complete presentation materials (Ting-Yu).  
   7. Finish map view, add tests, and clean up UI details (Kehan).  
   8. Address navigation edge cases and ensure smooth onboarding (Matthew).  
   9. Build out map feature planning and implementation (Sophia).

2. Progress and issues:  
   1. What you did  
      1. Completed major remaining feature work across the product, including map view implementation, AI-powered filtering, and navigation polish.  
      2. Updated and expanded UI test coverage, resolving many previously flaky tests and aligning flows with the finalized demo script.  
   2. What worked  
      1. Core experiences—map interactions, onboarding, navigation, and AI filtering—performed reliably during testing.  
      2. Demo flow felt significantly smoother after coordinated UI refinements and documentation updates.  
   3. What you learned  
      1. Gained a stronger understanding of debugging asynchronous UI behavior, delayed renders, and complex navigation timing.  
      2. Learned how to integrate new components (maps, AI models, notifications) into existing architecture without breaking existing flows.  
   4. Where you had trouble  
      1. Several UI tests were difficult to update due to dynamic rendering and state timing issues.  
      2. Coordinating demo consistency across multiple features and presenters required additional alignment and iteration.  
   5. Where you are stuck  
      1. A few UI tests remain intermittently flaky due to asynchronous update timing.  
      2. Some map-interaction edge cases and low-connectivity scenarios still need clarity before final integration.

3. Plans and goals for the next week:  
   1. Finalize all remaining UI tests, fix flaky cases, and complete missing test coverage across key flows.  
   2. Polish the demo end-to-end, including onboarding, map interactions, and slide deck readiness for presentation.  
   3. Clean up remaining UI details, documentation gaps, and repository structure to prepare for final submission.

**Individual Contributions:**  
Aaryan:

1. Last week’s goals:  
   1. Update profanity filtering to use AI to not ban just “bad words” but instead "harassment" 

2. Progress and issues:  
   1. What you did  
      1. Updated the profanity-filtering system to use an AI model that detects harassment rather than relying on simple keyword lists.  
      2. Added new classification logic and integrated it into the existing message-screening pipeline.  
   2. What worked  
      1. The AI-based filter caught nuanced harassment cases that keyword filters previously missed.  
      2. Integration with the existing backend pipeline worked smoothly with minimal refactoring.  
   3. What you learned  
      1. Learned how to fine-tune filtering logic so the system interprets context, not just individual words.  
      2. Gained experience designing safer content moderation mechanisms using AI-driven classifiers.  
   4. Where you had trouble  
      1. N/A  
   5. Where you are stuck  
      1. N/A

3. Plans and goals for the next week:  
   1. Improve harassment detection accuracy by refining prompts or model parameters and tuning threshold values.  
   2. Evaluate additional training examples and update logic to reduce false positives while maintaining safety.

Ray Xu:

1. Last week’s goals:  
   1. Fix the remaining failing UI tests and improve test reliability around asynchronous updates.  
   2. Support final polishing for the demo, including UI consistency checks and any required documentation tweaks.

2. Progress and issues:  
   1. What you did: Added text/call and email redirection features when users click on a phone number or email address in user profiles. Conducted final UI reviews to ensure consistent color themes, spacing, and typography across all screens.  
   2. What worked: The new redirection features integrated smoothly with the existing user profile modal, enhancing usability and giving the demo a more polished and realistic feel. UI consistency checks also helped identify and fix small visual misalignments across components.  
   3. What you learned: Gained a better understanding of linking external apps (like Mail and Messages) through React Native’s Linking API and how to handle conditional behaviors depending on the user’s device setup. Also learned to systematically test asynchronous UI updates using Jest’s wait utilities for stable test results.  
   4. Where you had trouble: n/a  
   5. Where you are stuck: n/a
