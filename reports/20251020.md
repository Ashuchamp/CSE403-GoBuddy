# Individual Contributions

## Aaryan
**Last week’s goals:**
- Set up the basic authentication and needed for the application
- Setting up firebase authentication and use firebase for the backend database
- Make one API to set user information

**Progress and issues:**  
**What you did**
- Set up google OAuth for authentication.
- Use primsa on prem for database rather than firestore
- would help with speed of dev and not needing to share personal google creds. Set up one API for setting user information

**What worked**
- The google authentication through and API and the API for setting user information

**What you learned**
- How google OAuth works, and how to manage user tokens

**Where you had trouble**
- Handling user tokens, I have trouble switching contexts on the backend

**Where you are stuck**
- Do more testing for making sure user information is not compromised because of switching user contexts on the backend

**Plans and goals for the next week:**
- Get server token handling working completely
- Set up more APIs to set and get user information and make new events.
- Make the events table

**What you learned:** Learned the dependencies between the frontend and backend setup, especially how Firebase authentication and Firestore access rely on consistent data models. We are also considering pivoting to Prisma as an alternative to Firebase.  
**Where you had trouble:** Firestore setup and connection to the frontend encountered delays due to authentication and data model uncertainty.  
**Where you are stuck:** Backend setup is still in progress; Firebase integration tasks (for me, login) will roll over to this week.
