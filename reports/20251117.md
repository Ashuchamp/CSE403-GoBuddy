## Progress and Issues
**What you did:**  
Implemented spam controls, fixed activity refresh logic, built the first version of the Notification Center, polished UI transitions, and added new UI tests across major flows.

**What worked:**  
Centralizing activity state fixed refresh issues, and backend rate limiting effectively reduced spam. Notifications triggered correctly for most event types.

**What you learned:**  
We learned that session state timing heavily affects UI consistency and that mapping backend events to structured notifications requires careful design.

**Where you had trouble:**  
Notification rendering still lags in some cases, and UI tests were flaky due to asynchronous state updates.

**Where you are stuck:**  
Some notifications still fail to appear without a manual refresh, and the architecture for AI recommendations is not fully decided yet.

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- Complete Notification Center Integration (**3 days**)  
- Integrate AI-Based Activity and People Recommendations (**3 days**)  
- Extend Test Coverage for New Features (**3 days**)

## Ray Xu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Write unit tests for CreateActivityScreen.  
Verify test coverage and update the developer guide accordingly.  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Completed unit tests for CreateActivityScreen, checked overall test coverage, and updated the developer guide with clearer testing instructions.  
- **What worked:** Tests for form validation, conditional UI, and navigation were stable after refining mocks. Coverage improved and documentation became more structured for future handoff.  
- **What you learned:** Gained experience testing multi-step screens and authenticated flows. Learned better ways to align mocks with backend schemas and document common testing patterns.  
- **Where you had trouble:** N/A  
- **Where you are stuck:** N/A  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Add remaining UI tests  
Finalize documentation updates  
Support final demo refinement

## Ting-Yu Hsu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Write unit tests for MyActivity Screen.  
Check current test coverage and make corresponding updates to the developer guide.  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Complete test for MyActivity Screen, checked test coverage.  
- **What worked:** The tests for screen display, navigation, and mock data worked well after some adjustments. Coverage improved, and the documentation is now easier to follow.  
- **What you learned:** Gained more experience testing screens that rely on user login and data fetching, and improved how to write and organize testing instructions.  
- **Where you had trouble:** N/A  
- **Where you are stuck:** N/A  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Check and update all remaining UI tests.  
Finalize documentation.  
Work on the final demo with the group, improve and update the final slide.

## Kehan Jin
**Last week’s goals:**  
Debug and fix the activity refresh issue after new activity creation (**1 day**)  
Polish UI transitions and animations for smoother user experience (**1 day**)  
Review and integrate peer feedback (**1 day**)  
Add ui tests (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** I fixed the activity refresh bug, improved several UI transitions, incorporated peer feedback into the activity screens, and added new UI tests for core flows.  
- **What worked:** Refactoring the refresh logic resolved the stale activity list problem, and the updated transitions made navigation feel more responsive. Peer feedback helped simplify a few UI elements and reduce clutter.  
- **What you learned:** I learned how centralizing state updates improves consistency across screens and how small animation timing changes can significantly improve perceived smoothness.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Certain UI transitions caused flickering when nested navigators were involved, and a few UI tests failed intermittently due to async rendering differences across devices.  
- **Where you are stuck:** There are still cases where activity refresh doesn’t trigger on slower networks, and one of the new UI tests remains flaky even after adding waits and retries.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Fully stabilize the activity refresh logic across different network conditions (**2 days**)  
Continue refining UI transitions and eliminate flickering in nested screens (**1 days**)  
Strengthen asynchronous UI tests and fix remaining flaky cases (**2 days**)  
Assist in integrating new Notification Center UI components into existing flows (**1 days**)

## Matthew Lua
**Last week’s goals:**  
Refine navigation flow and polish authentication (**2 days**)  
Improve session management & logout (**2 days**)  
Complete Final integration & prep demo (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Centralized auth guards and refined Login → Home/Profile routing. Added error states (invalid UW email, expired session, network failure) and basic retries. Helped with final integration testing and fixed auth/nav edge cases found in CI and beta runs.  
- **What worked:** Sessions usually persist across restarts; foreground checks refresh UI reliably. Logout clears caches and resets navigation without back-navigation leaks.  
- **What you learned:** How to adapt front-end logic quickly when backend schemas and expected authentication responses change. Better patterns for handling token refresh, failed auth attempts, and state resets.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Validating session state during app resume occasionally conflicted with manual navigation triggers.  
- **Where you are stuck:** A few edge cases involving expired sessions still cause unpredictable routing behavior.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Finalize all authentication flows (**2 days**)  
Complete full navigation polish (**1–2 days**)

## Sophia Su
**Last week’s goals:**  
Build the feature of a notification center (**3 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** I implemented the full UI for the Notification Center, connected it to the backend event stream, and added initial tests to confirm notifications display correctly.  
- **What worked:** The core notification list renders reliably, and the UI updates correctly for most event types when new backend events arrive.  
- **What you learned:** I learned how important clean listener management is for real-time UI updates, and how mapping backend events to a consistent UI schema avoids rendering issues.  
- **Where you had trouble:** I ran into issues where some notifications appeared with delay or duplicated due to overlapping listeners, and had to adjust the state flow to reduce re-renders.  
- **Where you are stuck:** A few notification types still require a manual refresh to appear, and I'm still debugging whether the issue is from caching, listener cleanup, or backend timing.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Finalize and stabilize Notification Center logic, including real-time updates  
Work with backend to define final notification schema and event mapping  
Add UI tests for notification filtering, marking as read, and navigation
