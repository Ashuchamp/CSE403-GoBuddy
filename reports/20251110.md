## Progress and Issues
**What you did:**  
This week, we finalized and polished the UI across all major views, implemented refined error handling on both the frontend and backend, and conducted full end-to-end beta testing. We completed and rehearsed the demo presentation, finalized documentation for handoff, and integrated demo mode data to simulate realistic app interactions.  

**What worked:**  
The UI performed consistently across devices with improved responsiveness and smoother navigation. Error-handling logic and backend error codes were successfully standardized, improving debugging and stability. Testing flows for authentication, activity creation, and accept/decline features were stable, with coverage significantly expanded across core user paths.  

**What you learned:**  
We deepened our understanding of React Native UI optimization, asynchronous testing, and navigation guards. We learned the importance of aligning mock data with backend structures for demos and using consistent error-handling conventions across modules. Edge-case testing and detailed documentation also proved critical for smooth handoff.  

**Where you had trouble:**  
Some asynchronous test cases showed flaky behavior due to delayed rendering or inconsistent mock data. A few API response delays impacted activity refresh logic, and navigation transitions occasionally displayed brief blank screens during authentication resolution.  

**Where you are stuck:**  
We are still refining session-expiry handling and debugging refresh logic for activity views to ensure seamless state updates after new activity creation.

- Add final UI tests and verify overall test coverage (**2 days**)  
- Refine navigation flow and session management for consistent user experience (**2 days**)  
- Conduct final demo preparation and ensure app readiness for handoff (**2 days**)

Solidify error states and handle errors gracefully  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Implemented backend error handling for user authentication and activity creation.  
- **What worked:** All the implementations worked.  
- **What you learned:** Learned to standardize API error codes across modules, improving consistency and debugging efficiency.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Faced minor issues syncing frontend error displays with new backend responses.  
- **Where you are stuck:** Currently refining error propagation to ensure all failed requests return descriptive messages.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Add spam control for the app to avoid too frequent connection requests and joining activity requests. (**4 days**)

## Ray Xu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Beta release presentation slides.  
Front end tests for all other screens.  
Review and document test coverage results in the developer guide.  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Finished the beta release presentation slides with Ting-yu. Completed unit tests for AuthScreen and ProfileScreen.  
- **What worked:** Presentation flow and visual style were consistent and well-received. The test environment was stable after initial configuration, and component rendering/assertions worked as expected.  
- **What you learned:** Improved familiarity with testing authenticated flows and conditional UI rendering. Learned to better isolate components using mocks for navigation and Firebase auth.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Spent time adjusting mock implementations for Firebase and navigation props. Some UI elements needed explicit testIDs to be reliably selected in tests.  
- **Where you are stuck:** N/A  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Write unit tests for CreateActivityScreen.  
Verify test coverage and update the developer guide accordingly.

## Ting-Yu Hsu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Fix timing issues and async behavior in tests (**2 days**)  
Improve test coverage for Accept/Decline and empty state cases (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Finished beta release presentation slides with Ray Xu. Added tests covering for accept and decline interactions.  
- **What worked:** The Accept/Decline logic now correctly reflects in the UI during tests.  
- **What you learned:** Importance of properly mocking asynchronous data sources. Edge-case testing is essential for user-facing flows.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Some test cases flaked due to delayed rendering even with mock data.  
- **Where you are stuck:** N/A  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Write unit tests for MyActivity Screen.  
Check current test coverage and make corresponding updates to the developer guide.

## Kehan Jin
**Last week’s goals:**  
Refine UI responsiveness and error handling on activity view (**2 days**)  
Conduct end-to-end testing and finalize documentation for handoff (**2 days**)  
Work and prepare on demo presentation (**1 day**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Refined the activity view’s responsiveness and improved error handling for failed API calls. Completed end-to-end testing, finalized documentation, and helped prepare the demo presentation.  
- **What worked:** The responsive UI changes performed well across devices during testing. Enhanced error-handling logic improved overall app stability and user feedback.  
- **What you learned:** Learned how to optimize React Native layouts for different screen sizes and ratios. Gained skills in writing concise, maintainable documentation for team handoff.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Faced occasional delays and inconsistencies in API responses affecting test results.  
- **Where you are stuck:** Debugging the refresh logic to identify whether it’s a state or caching issue.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Debug and fix the activity refresh issue after new activity creation (**1 day**)  
Polish UI transitions and animations for smoother user experience (**1 day**)  
Review and integrate peer feedback (**1 day**)  
Add ui tests (**2 days**)

## Matthew Lua
**Last week’s goals:**  
Refine navigation flow and error handling between login, home, and profile (**2 days**)  
Add session validation and logout logic (**2 days**)  
Participate in final integration testing and demo preparation (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Refined the navigation flow between Login, Home and Profile using guarded routes. Wired the login/email-verification screens to live APIs and updated them to the latest data model. Participated in final integration testing, filed bugs, and fixed several navigation/auth edge cases.  
- **What worked:** Authentication redirects are now consistent; users with valid uw@edu sign-ins land on Home, incomplete profiles route to Profile setup. Logout reliably clears navigation stack and cached user state.  
- **What you learned:** Practical patterns for React Navigation guards. Coordinating async auth state with UI to avoid bugs.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Brief blank screens during route transitions before auth state is resolved.  
- **Where you are stuck:** A few edge cases around expired sessions mid-navigation.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Refine navigation flow and polish authentication (**2 days**)  
Improve session management & logout (**2 days**)  
Complete Final integration & prep demo (**2 days**)

## Sophia Su
**Last week’s goals:**  
Fix some small issues found in “Profile Page”: (**3 days**)  
- Remove skills & experience, preferred times, campus location  
- Make phone number only accepting correct format  
- Make school email unseen by others, user should set contact info themselves  
Walk through the mock data to ensure they are ready for the beta release representation (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Added mock data to the real app with the backend under a demo mode. Added the button to switch to demo mode in the login page. Removed unnecessary sections for user profile. Made phone numbers only allow valid phone number format. Contact information only can be seen when both users connect with each other.  
- **What worked:** All the above implementations worked. The demo app worked well.  
- **What you learned:** It is important to have a clear logic of a demo app and make user cases clear and specific.  
- **Where you had trouble:** I had trouble trying to transfer the mock data from the frontend to the backend.  
- **Where you are stuck:** I got stuck when deciding whether to let users see other’s contact information when joining a group activity. I finally decided to allow users to see each other’s contact information only when they are connected.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Build the feature of a notification center (**3 days**)
