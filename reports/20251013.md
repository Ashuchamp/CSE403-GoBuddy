# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals
n/a for the first week.

## Progress and Issues
- UI Mockup of application in Figma to show user stories  
- Decided on using contact-exchange function. In-app messaging will be a stretch goal.  
- Decided on using uw.edu as the restricted domain to make sure only UW students can access the application. No password needed.  
- Decided on using Firebase for data storage.  
- For profanity checks, we will use better-profanity (a rule-based python library) for core filtering, layered with profanity-check (ML-based).  

**What worked:**  
- Team collaboration in Figma was efficient; feedback cycles were quick.  
- The domain restriction and Firebase integration decisions streamlined the project setup.  

**What we learned:**  
- Learned to balance functionality scope by prioritizing core features and deferring messaging to a stretch goal.  
- Gained familiarity with different Python-based profanity detection approaches and Firebase’s integration advantages.

**Where we had trouble:**  
- Coordination of component design between frontend developers took longer than expected.  
- Some visual inconsistencies between light and dark mode themes appeared in Figma prototypes.  

**Where we are stuck:**  
- Awaiting confirmation on the app’s onboarding flow to finalize button placements and transitions.
