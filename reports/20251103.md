## Progress and Issues
**What you did:**  
Our team completed full backend–frontend integration and tested all major workflows including authentication, activity browsing, and recommendation features. Unit tests were written for multiple screens, and a CI/CD pipeline was successfully implemented for automated builds and deployments. Beta release testing was performed to ensure feature completeness and stability.  

**What worked:**  
End-to-end testing confirmed seamless navigation across views and correct data flow between Prisma layers. The recommendation feature accurately generated suggestions using user tags. The CI/CD pipeline reduced deployment time and increased testing efficiency. All critical UI components functioned as expected across devices.  

**What you learned:**  
We gained a stronger understanding of writing asynchronous tests for React Native, managing environment variables securely, and integrating mock data with live backend systems. Members also learned how to design stable APIs, optimize schemas, and configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases.  

**Where you had trouble:**  
Integration issues arose from inconsistent mock data and timing errors in asynchronous tests. Environment variable management initially caused CI failures. Minor UI discrepancies appeared during cross-device testing and had to be manually resolved.  

**Where you are stuck:**  
A few async test cases still show inconsistent behavior, and mock data remains partially visible after backend activation. The team is also refining error handling for UI edge cases and expanding test coverage before final handoff.

- Stabilize async test cases and improve test coverage (**2 days**)  
- Refine error handling and edge case management (**2 days**)  
- Conduct full end-to-end beta testing and final bug sweep (**2 days**)  
- Prepare demo presentation and finalize documentation for handoff (**2 days**)

# Individual Contributions

## Aaryan
**Last week’s goals:**  
Implement the back end infrastructure  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Implement the APIs needed for the app to function  
- **What worked:** The APIs worked as expected and the UI is able to use this data  
- **What you learned:** How to make a stable data schema  
- **Where you had trouble:** Deciding how many APIs to make. One master end point vs multiple endpoints  
- **Where you are stuck:** Nowhere right now  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Solidify error states and handle errors gracefully

## Ray Xu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Write tests for Firebase wiring (**2 days**)  
Add missing features for Browsing View (search and filter, tags and location chosen from list, not free text, +1 more can’t click, request UI keep the student page) (**2 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Added unit tests for ActivityDetailScreen and BrowseScreen.  
- **What worked:** Tests ran successfully after resolving formatting and configuration issues. The CI pipeline correctly detected and ran all test cases.  
- **What you learned:** Improved understanding of Jest and React Native Testing Library, especially handling asynchronous UI updates and component props.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Initially forgot to run auto-formatting on early commits, which caused Prettier check failures. Also forgot to switch to a new branch before committing, but CI checks helped catch inconsistencies early.  
- **Where you are stuck:** N/A  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
- Beta release presentation slides  
- Front end tests for all other screens  
- Review and document test coverage results in the developer guide

## Ting-Yu Hsu
**Last week’s goals:**  
Write tests for Request and Connection frontend views (**2 days**)  
Wire up front and back end for Request and Connection view firebase wiring (**3 days**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Wrote unit tests for displaying connection requests and handling Accept/Decline actions.  
- **What worked:** The screens render correctly with titles, messages, and buttons. Accept and Decline actions update the UI as expected. Empty state displays properly after all requests are declined.  
- **What you learned:** Learned how to simulate user actions with fireEvent. Understood how to structure tests for both static and dynamic UI states.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Faced timing issues in tests, actions happened before data was ready.  
- **Where you are stuck:** Still working on properly syncing UI with live Firebase updates. Need to stabilize async test cases for consistent results.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Fix timing issues and async behavior in tests (**2 days**)  
Improve test coverage for Accept/Decline and empty state cases (**2 days**)

## Kehan Jin
**Last week’s goals:**  
Help with final front and backend integration (**2 days**)  
Add any new features that come up for activity view (**2 days**)  
Test the app demo (**1 day**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Implemented automated CI/CD pipeline, updated activity view, downloaded and tested the app beta release, helped finish backend integration.  
- **What worked:** The CI/CD pipeline successfully automated build and deployment, reducing manual setup time.  
- **What you learned:** Learned how to configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and release workflows.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Encountered issues with environment variable management during the integration phase.  
- **Where you are stuck:** Still working on adding more comprehensive test cases to improve coverage for new features.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Refine UI responsiveness and error handling on activity view (**2 days**)  
Conduct end-to-end testing and finalize documentation for handoff (**2 days**)  
Work and prepare on demo presentation

## Matthew Lua
**Last week’s goals:**  
Complete end-to-end authentication testing once backend endpoints are live.  
Begin implementing basic navigation flow after login (redirect to home and user profile setup).  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Tested authentication flow with live backend endpoints. Implemented navigation from login to home and profile setup screens. Verified token storage and user session persistence.  
- **What worked:** Authentication and redirects worked smoothly with backend responses. Login sessions remained valid after app restarts.  
- **What you learned:** Gained experience managing authentication state and navigation timing. Learned to debug session handling and async navigation flows.  
- **Where you had trouble:** Encountered brief blank screen delays after login. Some redirects failed when login credentials were invalid.  
- **Where you are stuck:** Still refining navigation for expired sessions and incomplete profile setups.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Refine navigation flow and error handling between login, home, and profile (**2 days**)  
Add session validation and logout logic (**2 days**)  
Participate in final integration testing and demo preparation (**2 days**)

## Sophia Su
**Last week’s goals:**  
Finish and test the recommendation feature (**2 days**)  
Connect recommendation view with real user data for personalized suggestions (**1 day**)  
Fix any front end discrepancy (**1 day**)  

**Progress and issues:**  
- **What you did:** Built the recommendation feature and tested it on Expo Go. Used user’s tags to personalize recommended activities. Fixed “My Activities Page” to categorize and sort created activities. Added mock data for beta release.  
- **What worked:** “Recommendation Page” works smoothly. “My Activities Page” works with multiple use cases. Mock data ready for beta release.  
- **What you learned:** I learned to add mock data comprehensively for all use cases.  
- **Where you had trouble:** I had trouble when I found out that there were use cases I didn’t consider when I implemented the “My Activities Page.”  
- **Where you are stuck:** After I enabled the back end, some mock data still present which is not expected because in real life usage, there shouldn’t be any mock data.  

**Plans and goals for the next week:**  
Fix some small issues found in “Profile Page” (**3 days**)  
- Make tags chosen from a list  
- Remove skills & experience, preferred times, campus location  
- Make phone number only accepting correct format  
- Make school email unseen by others, user should set contact info themselves  
- Walk through the mock data to ensure they are ready for the beta release representation
